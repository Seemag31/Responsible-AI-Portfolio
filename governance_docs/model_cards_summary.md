# Model Cards for Model Reporting — Summary Notes

## 1. Purpose of Model Cards
Model cards provide structured documentation about trained machine learning models to improve transparency, accountability, and responsible use. They communicate model capabilities, limitations, and appropriate uses to both internal teams and external stakeholders.

## 2. Key Sections of a Model Card
| Section | What It Contains | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Model Details | Model type, version, developer | Supports traceability |
| Intended Use | Appropriate and inappropriate use cases | Helps prevent misuse |
| Factors | Groups or conditions affecting performance | Highlights potential bias |
| Metrics | Performance across groups | Reveals disparities |
| Evaluation Data | Datasets used for testing | Provides performance context |
| Ethical Considerations | Fairness, safety, and societal concerns | Supports responsible deployment |
| Caveats & Recommendations | Known limitations | Encourages cautious use |

## 3. Transparency Benefits
Model cards make assumptions, performance limits, and risks visible. They support accountability by allowing reviewers and users to understand when and how a model should be used.

## 4. Practical Applications
Model cards are typically created at model release and updated as the system evolves. They are used in governance reviews, product approvals, and compliance documentation.

## 5. Limitations or Challenges
Model cards depend on honest and thorough reporting, may become outdated, and cannot by themselves prevent unsafe or inappropriate use.

## 6. Key Takeaway
> Model cards transform internal model documentation into stakeholder-facing transparency tools.
