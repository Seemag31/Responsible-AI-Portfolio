# Datasheets for Datasets — Summary Notes

## 1. Purpose of Datasheets
Datasheets document the origins, composition, collection methods, and intended uses of datasets. They address risks that arise when datasets are reused without understanding how they were created or what limitations they have.

## 2. Major Sections of a Datasheet
| Section | Key Questions Answered | Governance Value |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Motivation | Why was this dataset created? | Reveals intent and potential bias |
| Composition | Who or what is represented? | Detects imbalance and gaps |
| Collection Process | How was data gathered? | Highlights consent and privacy issues |
| Preprocessing | What cleaning or labeling was done? | Improves transparency and reproducibility |
| Uses | Appropriate and inappropriate uses | Prevents misuse |
| Distribution | Who can access the dataset? | Supports risk control |
| Maintenance | How is the dataset updated? | Ensures reliability over time |

## 3. Risk Reduction
Datasheets reduce hidden bias, misuse, and ethical blind spots by making dataset limitations and assumptions explicit.

## 4. Practical Applications
Datasheets should be created when datasets are built or curated and maintained alongside the dataset as it evolves.

## 5. Limitations or Open Questions
Creating datasheets can be time-intensive, often conflicts with fast development cycles, and may be difficult for legacy datasets where documentation is missing.

## 6. Key Takeaway
> If model cards explain the model, datasheets explain the data that shaped the model.
